    "**Global Fishing Watch** has obtained tracking data of fishing vessels from 1) Automatic Identification System (AIS) devices and 2) Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) that are regulated by national goverment authorities. The overall goal is to use these positional data to predict fishing activites in the world's oceans.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Automatic Identification System (AIS)*: AIS trackers broadcast vessel identificaiton information and location. The speed and direction of the vessel can also be calculated from AIS data at various timepoints. GFW has built models to predict fishing activity of vessels based on AIS tracking data. A major drawback of using AIS data to model fishing activity is that only a small fraction of fishing vessels are equiped with AIS devices. More so, many of these vessels lacking AIS trackers may be engaging in illeagal fishing activities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS)*: VMS are established by national government authorties to monitor vessel movements with GPS. Vessels broadcast their positions to satellites and this information is captured by the authorities. VMS data is typically not made available to the public. Through collaborations with national governments like Indonesia, Panama, Peru, and Chile, GFW has been able to obtain VMS data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The matching problem:** To get a better picture of fishing activity, we could overlap AIS and VMS location data. AIS devices broadcast vessel location every three minutes (Taconet et al., 2019), resulting in accurate position given by longitute/latitute coordinates. In contrast, VMS devices broadcast less frequently. I do not know the rate of VMS  broadcasting but I suspect this it is once every few hours to once per day. This means that VMS positional data could be less accurate depending on the speed of the vessel and when the GPS receiver transmits a signal. This creates several problems. One problem is that the same vessel could have different (non-overlapping) AIS and GPS coordinates. As shown in the diagram below (left), for example, a vessel is moving at 10 knots (~18.5km/hr). If GPS singal is transmitted every hour then the AIS and GPS positional data for the same vessel could be up to 18.5km apart. Another potential problem is that overlapping AIS and GPS could represent two, instead of one, vessel (diagram, right). \n",

    "\n",
    "**Goal:** *Using the AIS and GPS data available, construct a model to predict whether overlapping AIS and GPS tracks are coming from one or two vessels?* \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I propose three ideas for possible models. AIS data can be obtained from [GFW's website](https://globalfishingwatch.org/data-download/datasets/public-training-data-v1). I do not have access to vessel GPS data and therefore need to make some assumptions when describing the model. I could not find evidence that that AIS and VMS use the same identifer naming/number scheme, so I assume that vessel identifiers are different such that it is not possible to match vessels simply by their ID (this would be too easy!). \n"
